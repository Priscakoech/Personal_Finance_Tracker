To connect your crypto wallets (Binance, Bybit or MetaMask), follow these steps:

# 1. **Choose Your Wallet**
     Select the wallet you want to link:
     Binance, Bybit or MetaMask.
     Then accompany them with their 
     respective *Blockchain Network*

# 2. **Enter API Creds + Wallet Address**
   - You will need your **API Key** and 
     **API Secret** (Binance & Bybit).
   - MetaMask doesn't require them.

# 3. **How to Get Your Wallet Creds**
     *[color=00afff]For Binance & Bybit[/color]*:  
     • Go to your wallet settings
     • API Management
     • Create a new API key
     • Copy both the API Key and
       the API Secret.

     *[color=00afff]For MetaMask[/color]*:
     You only need a wallet address.
     • Open your MetaMask app
     • Tap your account name
     • Your public address will be 
       copied automatically. 
       *(it starts with "0x...")*

# 4. **Security Reminder**
   - **Keep your API keys private**.
     Never share them with anyone.
   - Only grant "read-only" permissions 
     when creating your API keys
     (no withdrawal access).
   - To further secure your wallets, the
     API Creds you are providing are 
     encrypted and stored locally on
     your device.

# 5. **Save and Connect**
     Pate your API Creds or Wallet Address,
     then tap **Link Wallet**. Once connected,
     your wallet transactions will start
     syncing automatically.
